            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Maria works as an ecologist, studying wildlife migration patterns, specifically focusing on bird migrations and their relationship with changing climates. Her work involves analyzing large datasets to extract meaningful insights and presenting them in an understandable format for policy makers and environmental organizations. Recently, Maria has become interested in using technology to enhance her research, especially in the areas of real-time migration tracking and data visualization.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the MiRT platform to analyze and visualize migration patterns of birds, humans, and extraterrestrial migrations in a geographical context.</li>
                <li>Interact with the interactive map to explore migration trends in real-time and filter data by categories like species, migration type, or season.</li>
                <li>Generate and export detailed reports on migration data (in PNG, JPG, or PDF format) to share with colleagues and researchers.</li>
                <li>Use the SPARQL endpoint to explore additional knowledge about migration from DBpedia and Wikidata.</li>
                <li>Provide insights and suggestions on how the tool can be improved to better suit research and data analysis needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Frustrations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited options for customizing the migration markers and their visibility, which makes it harder to focus on specific data types during analysis.</li>
                <li>Lack of sufficient real-time data for human migrations, especially regarding political events or calamities.</li>
                <li>Difficulty in quickly exporting and sharing interactive map visualizations with colleagues.</li>
                <li>Navigation challenges when trying to zoom in/out on the map and filter for specific migration events.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Maria logs into the MiRT platform to track the migration of birds in a specific region during the spring season.</li>
                <li>She navigates to the Dashboard where she views the interactive map populated with markers representing various migration types (birds, humans, extraterrestrial).</li>
                <li>She clicks on a bird migration marker to get more detailed information, including GPS coordinates, date, and related comments from Reddit users.</li>
                <li>Maria uses the filter options to hide the human migration markers and focus on bird migrations.</li>
                <li>She customizes the map markers to make bird migration markers appear in white to better stand out against the map background.</li>
                <li>Maria uses the "stats" button to view the most discussed subtopics regarding bird migrations in Reddit comments and views visualizations of the migration data.</li>
                <li>After analyzing the data, Maria exports the map and relevant statistics in PDF format to present to a research conference.</li>
                <li>She submits feedback about the platform's usability through the "Contact" section to suggest improvements in real-time data tracking for human migrations.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <p>Maria uses the MiRT platform to analyze migration data, filter it based on different migration types and regions, and interact with the real-time map to gain insights into migration trends. She customizes the map's visual elements to help with her analysis, exports detailed reports for presentations, and provides feedback to improve the platform's features for better research capabilities.</p>
