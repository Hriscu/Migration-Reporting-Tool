            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Alex is an urban planner with a keen interest in how technology can be leveraged to design smarter, more sustainable cities. He is particularly passionate about how migration trends (whether human, animal, or even extraterrestrial) impact urban development. Alex works with local governments and organizations to understand migration data and to predict how population movements may affect urban infrastructure, resources, and environmental sustainability.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the MiRT platform to visualize migration data and understand trends in urban areas impacted by human migration.</li>
                <li>Analyze the seasonal and geographical distribution of various migration types to plan for future urban development.</li>
                <li>Customize map markers to highlight specific data, such as migration routes near urban areas, to inform planning decisions.</li>
                <li>Use the tool’s statistics and subtopics features to understand public discussions around migration, particularly in relation to urban environments.</li>
                <li>Export migration data and reports in various formats (PNG, PDF, JPG) to include in urban planning reports and presentations for city officials.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Frustrations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited filtering options for different types of human migration, making it harder to isolate data relevant to specific urban planning projects.</li>
                <li>Not enough integration with real-time data on population density or urban infrastructure challenges connected to migration flows.</li>
                <li>The map’s default markers are too generic and need to be more customizable to represent complex urban migration data.</li>
                <li>Exporting interactive elements of the map to static formats doesn't always preserve the map's functionality, making it harder to share interactive data with stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Alex logs into the MiRT platform to examine human migration data related to urban centers that are experiencing rapid population growth.</li>
                <li>He navigates to the interactive map and selects the "Human Migrations" filter to focus only on human migration data.</li>
                <li>After zooming into a specific city, Alex clicks on several migration markers to examine more detailed information, including migration dates and comments from users discussing local migration events.</li>
                <li>He customizes the markers to display in color to better differentiate them from the general map view and makes the migration markers larger for easy identification in crowded urban areas.</li>
                <li>Using the “stats” button, Alex views a detailed distribution of human migration, identifying trends in areas with high population growth and corresponding infrastructure needs.</li>
                <li>He uses the “subtopics” button to explore discussions on Reddit related to urban migration, especially topics around housing, traffic, and social services that are relevant to urban planners.</li>
                <li>After completing his analysis, Alex exports the data and map as a PDF report, which he shares with local government officials to inform urban development strategies.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <p>Alex uses the MiRT platform to explore migration trends, specifically human migrations in urban areas, to assist in city planning and urban development projects. He customizes the interactive map, filters migration data, and analyzes relevant statistics and discussions to inform his planning decisions. He also exports reports for use in meetings with government officials and urban planners.</p>
