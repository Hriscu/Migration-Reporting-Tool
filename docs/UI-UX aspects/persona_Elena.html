            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Elena is a research scientist focusing on the effects of climate change on wildlife migrations. She works at a research institute where she analyzes patterns of animal migrations, especially those of birds and marine life, in relation to shifts in climate and seasonality. Elena is passionate about using data to understand these patterns and advocate for policies that can protect ecosystems. Her work includes collaborating with environmental organizations and publishing findings in scientific journals.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use MiRT to track how climate change is affecting animal migration patterns, specifically birds and marine species.</li>
                <li>Visualize seasonal changes in migration and correlate these with data on rising temperatures, sea levels, and changing weather patterns.</li>
                <li>Analyze migration data in real-time to predict future trends and suggest conservation strategies for endangered species.</li>
                <li>Explore the public discussions about climate change and migration, especially those related to the impact of human activity on wildlife.</li>
                <li>Export and share the results of her research in an accessible format (PNG, PDF, JPG) with colleagues, policymakers, and the general public.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Frustrations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The difficulty of correlating migration data with specific climate change factors like temperature or precipitation variations in the platform.</li>
                <li>Lack of advanced features to predict migration patterns based on environmental changes, which limits the platform's use for future forecasting.</li>
                <li>Not being able to compare long-term migration data with historical climate data in a single view, which would make analysis more comprehensive.</li>
                <li>While the platform provides valuable migration data, it's challenging to create customized alerts for significant shifts in migration trends linked to environmental factors.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Scenario</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Elena logs into MiRT to track how birds are migrating earlier in the year due to rising temperatures.</li>
                <li>She navigates to the interactive map and selects "Bird Migrations" from the category filters.</li>
                <li>She zooms in on the region of the Arctic, where birds are migrating earlier than expected. She clicks on a marker to view additional information, such as migration routes and the related season and temperature data.</li>
                <li>Elena uses the "stats" button to review how temperature fluctuations correlate with earlier migrations in this region, and she compares this data to historical trends from other sources.</li>
                <li>She customizes the map markers to represent bird species with different colors, which helps her quickly identify the migration routes of endangered species.</li>
                <li>Elena then clicks on the "subtopics" button to view Reddit discussions around the effects of climate change on bird migrations and conservation efforts. She reads about recent studies and public concerns regarding the displacement of species.</li>
                <li>Elena exports the map and data visualization in PDF format to include in a presentation she is preparing for a climate change conference.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <p>Elena uses the MiRT platform to track the effects of climate change on wildlife migration patterns, with a particular focus on birds and marine life. She customizes the platform's features to visualize migration routes in the context of changing environmental conditions, analyzes real-time data to predict future patterns, and shares her findings with the scientific community and policymakers. Elena aims to use the platform not only to understand current migration trends but also to help drive conservation efforts and environmental policies.</p>
