# MiRT (Migration Reporting Tool)
 
<p>Considering observations provided by users (e.g., messages posted on a social network) or various sensors, develop an "intelligent" Web system capable to generate in real-time an interactive map regarding the migrations performed by various entities (birds, humans, robots, extraterrestrial beings) in a specific context (season, working, politic factors, calamity). A migration-related event could be directly reported – in conjunction to the GPS info + optional (meta)data – into the implemented platform or by using #mig-here hashtag on an existing social Web application (Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo). Several useful statistics and visualizations about the migratory habits of specific species – including information on geographical areas, climate, seasons, user comments/images/videos, etc. – should be offered by a SPARQL endpoint – possibly enhanced by additional knowledge from DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Visit also Migration Data Portal. Bonus: adopting a stream processing approach.</p>
