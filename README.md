# MiRT (Migration Reporting Tool)
 
<p>Considering observations provided by users (e.g., messages posted on a social network) or various sensors, develop an "intelligent" Web system capable to generate in real-time an interactive map regarding the migrations performed by various entities (birds, humans, robots, extraterrestrial beings) in a specific context (season, working, politic factors, calamity). A migration-related event could be directly reported – in conjunction to the GPS info + optional (meta)data – into the implemented platform or by using #mig-here hashtag on an existing social Web application (Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo). Several useful statistics and visualizations about the migratory habits of specific species – including information on geographical areas, climate, seasons, user comments/images/videos, etc. – should be offered by a SPARQL endpoint – possibly enhanced by additional knowledge from DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Visit also Migration Data Portal. <b>Bonus:</b> adopting a stream processing approach.</p>

# Requirements

<p> The most important requirements are:</p>

* ⌛ The project consists of a (micro-)service-based Web application (i.e., a software system) developed by using existing social and semantic Web technologies.

* ✔️ A project proposal could be chosen by maximum 4 teams. Each team must have 2 members.

* ⌛ For the final assessment, the team must provide the full functionality of the developed solution, according to the specific requirements stated in the project description and discussed in the first 7 weeks of the semester during practical works (WADe labs).

* ⌛ The project should be developed and deployed according to the actual practices in Web engineering (e.g., documentation, test driven development, modularity, bug reporting, etc.) by using a modern approach regarding source-code management like Bitbucket, GitHub, or similar cloud-based solutions.

* ⌛ Resource representations to be processed by the (Web/mobile) client will include a valid HTML5 code, plus schema.org and RDFa constructs.

* ⌛ Each thing (resource) of interest will be exposed (and shared) by using a generated URL and/or QR code.

* ⌛ The code-source and specific content (data) must be available under the terms of the open source licenses and Creative Commons – consult Software Licenses in Plain English and Social Coding and Open Software.

<p> The most important requirements are:</p>

* ⌛ A proper use of various "exotic" programming paradigms like functional, distributed, parallel, reactive, etc.

* ⌛ Adopting a cloud-based solution – i.e. for the (RDF) data storage and/or the Web application deployment.

* ⌛ Using specific design patterns regarding the Web application architecture and/or the knowledge modeling – for example, applying various ontology design patterns.

* ⌛ Creativity and social impact of the proposed solution.

* ⌛ Team work – a penalty of 2 points for each assessed component will be applied for a 1-person project effort. Each member of the team will specify the most important contributions to the developed solution.

* ⌛ Implementation maturity – study Software Quality Checklist and Web Developer Checklist.

* ⌛ Overall impression – e.g., the suitable use of discussed Web technologies, impact on the end users + usability, business aspects, performance, further directions of development – consider things users care about.

# Deliverables & Calendar

<p> At the end of semester's week #17, a student team must deliver the following resources, according to each project proposal: </p>

1. ⌛ A public wiki associated to the WADe project repository should record the solution's progress. The content must be available in English language and minimally tagged with project, infoiasi, wade, and web. All project's deliverables must be referred by this wiki.

2. ⌛ A general (service-oriented) architecture of the Web application + the overall design from the point of view of a software engineer (for example: main modules, software architecture diagrams, input/output data formats, data/task flows, etc.) and concerning the end users.

3. ⌛ An OpenAPI specification regarding the REST API – or, alternatively, a schema for the GraphQL API – provided by the project, including various usage examples and pragmatic case studies.

4. ⌛ A Scholarly HTML technical report. Its digital content will be equivalent to a minimum 10 printed A4 pages) describing the most significant details about:

* ⌛ Internal data structures/models to be used and managed by the Web application.

* ⌛ Technical aspects concerning the implemented API(s) – by adopting REST and/or GraphQL – according to the proposed Web system architecture.

* ⌛ Considerations regarding the designed/reused RDF-based knowledge model(s) – for example, the expressiveness and real usage of the proposed and/or reused vocabulary, taxonomy or ontology in the context of the developed system.

* ⌛ Pragmatic use of external data/knowledge sources – e.g., using various knowledge bases like Wikidata and DBpedia, plus several non-trivial SPARQL queries of interest. Also, explain how the solution conforms to the linked data principles.

* ⌛ A user guide of the developed solution – also available as a Scholarly HTML document including screen-captures and explaining at least 3 case-studies –, plus a (U)HD-quality video demonstration (duration: 5—7 minutes).

5. ⌛ A fully implemented and deployed – e.g. in the cloud – solution of the software project.

<p> <b> All deliverables are mandatory. </b></p>

## 💎 Bonuses

<p> Each team could be awarded with an amount of maximum 3 points for: </p>

* ⌛ adopting SHACL to validate RDF data,

* ⌛ proposing a decentralized approach based on the Solid – an open standard for structuring data, digital identities, and applications on the Web,

* ⌛ using various deep/machine learning and/or blockchain-based techniques,

* ⌛ discussing and adopting methods and/or paradigms regarding the user interaction/experience,

* ⌛ specifying a set of proper statecharts – details of interest, 

* ⌛ considering significant aspects with respect to the interoperability, performance, and/or security of the implemented solution.

<p> The presentation of the project has allocated maximum 20 minutes per team, including questions. </p>
